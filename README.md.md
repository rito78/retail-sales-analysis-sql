## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL** – Data querying and analysis
- **CSV Files** – Data storage format
- **MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite** (any SQL-based RDBMS)
- **MS Excel** – Initial data review and validation (optional)

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process

The following steps were applied to clean the raw dataset:

- Removed duplicate records
- Handled missing or null values
- Standardized column names
- Corrected inconsistent data formats
- Validated numerical fields (sales, quantity, revenue)

The cleaned dataset is saved as:

```
Cleaned_Retail_Sales.csv
```

## 📊 Analysis Performed

Using SQL, the following analyses were conducted:

- Total sales and revenue analysis
- Monthly and yearly sales trends
- Top-selling products and categories
- Customer-wise purchase analysis
- Average order value and quantity analysis

All queries are available in:

```
SQL_Query.sql
```
